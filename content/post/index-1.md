## Combined Data

[Jump to the data](#list-of-government-of-canada-it-projects-over-1-million)

This data was collected in response to three written questions in the House of Commons, from June 2016, May 2019, and April 2022. Each question asked federal government departments to report ongoing or planned IT projects over $1M.

These responses were collected in three sessional papers: [8555-421-266](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/pdf/8555-421-266.pdf), [8555-421-2460](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/pdf/8555-421-2460.pdf), and [8530-441-13-505-b](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/pdf/8530-441-13-505-b.pdf). Sessional papers are public information; they can be requested by [emailing the Library of Parliament](mailto:info@parl.gc.ca).

For each project, the data includes: 

*   Description
*   Total cost
*   Estimated completion date

### About the combined data

The table below incorporates the [2016 data](/2016/), the [2019 data](/2019/), and the [2022 data](/2022/). The 2016 data includes 398 projects, the 2019 data includes 463 projects, and the 2022 data includes 495 projects. 192 projects appear in at least two datasets, and 38 projects appear in all three datasets. 

For the 192 projects appearing in multiple datasets, the combined data can be used to triangulate changes in project budget and timelines (“ahead of schedule”, “on schedule”, or “behind schedule”). Projects included only in the 2022 data are marked as “new”. Projects from previous years’ dataset are marked as “complete” if their estimated completion date was before April 25, 2022 (the benchmark date of the 2022 data), and as “unknown” if the estimated completion date was later but the project is not included in the 2022 data.

Two departments (National Defence and Shared Services Canada) did not provide a complete list of projects in response to the latest request. See the [2022 sessional paper](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/pdf/8530-441-13-505-b.pdf) for more information.
