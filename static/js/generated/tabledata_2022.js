        "description": "GCDocs implementation in First Nations Inuit Health Branch will most likely be completed in fiscal year 22-23. The GCDocs infrastructure and software is now 5+ years old and requires renewal. Upgrading will improve performance, add functionality and improve system availability. ISC and CIRNAC are evolving quicker than the support model can maintain (folder structure, permissions, intregration, search) and content is now scattered throughout various tools (GCdocs, SharePoint, OneDrive, shared drives). Users today must play an active role in the life cycle of unstructured information by determining it's value, saving it to a specific folder in a complex structure and manage permissions. There is a requirement to update current hardware, add hardware to ensure availability and archival functionality, integrate GCDocs with M365 (MS Teams) and finally assess auto classification options to reduce system complexity for the end user.",

The second component is the migration of Statistics Canada's current workloads found in the Tunney's Pasture Data Center to the secure cloud environment. The third is the migration of the Foundational Services supported by Shared Services Canada to the Borden Enterprise Data Center. This allows Statistics Canada to take advantage of the benefits that a cloud environment provides users on rapid scaling and provisioning of Cloud computational resources. This is a cornerstone that allows the department to further it capabilities in data and analytics.

The department is now preparing to migrate from RDIMS to GCDOCS on the corporate network. The plan is to fully implement GCDOCS in the departmentally assigned Azure (MSFT) environment (provided by Shared Services Canada) by July 2022. While implementing GCDOCS, we are also planning a phased-in approach for RDIMS migration to GCDOCS, starting with active documents, then legacy ones. During the implementation of GCDOCS and migration from RDIMS, PS employees will continue to have Read-Only access to RDIMS until all documents have successfully migrated.  The implementation of GCDOCS at PS will be on Premise (not through Public Service and Procurement Canada managed service) and is expected to be on Cloud Azure. GCDOCS, as it is currently with RDIMS, is deemed mission critical for PS and must have failover and disaster recovery (DR) sites to ensure its availability. The GCDOCS project started in October 2020. Information Management, with the help of consultants, have completed consultations with every business unit in the department and have developed a new functional based folder structure. PS has created a GCdocs solution in Smart UI and a direct integration with M365. Employees and consultants have been working on creating an enterprise GCDOCS solution in Azure Kubernetes container. We have also purchased DMZ servers to add functionality to GCDOCS including co-authoring.",

The Transportation Security Clearance Modernization project consists of five inter-related initiatives which help to respond to these challenges by: 1) digitizing the Transport Canada Security Clearance Application and adding the capability to upload documents, reducing the need for manual validation, mail-in and matching application to documents, reducing the environmental impact of printing and storing paper; and creating a common component for any project using DocumentUpload; 2) upgrading aging technology for the Transport Canada Automated Fingerprinting Information System which collects, exchanges and stores biometric data, a key input for security screening; 3) stabilizing the new decision support tool (Vault) which is experiencing Severity 1 issues since its launch to production in August 2021; improving the overall system\u2019s performance by automating manual processes and developing detailed reporting capabilities; 4) delivering a service blueprint and an online service portal concept; and 5) conducting an in-depth analysis and recommendations on policy changes and performance measures which provide potential to further improve service levels.",
