Regulations under this act (SFCR) will replace the 13 existing food regulations with one overarching regulation. The SFCR will establish consistent, prevention-focused requirements for foods that are domestically produced, imported, or exported from Canada, and some requirements applicable to food that is traded intra-provincially. It also includes the fundamental food safety principles of licensing, traceability, and preventative control. These new rules are stronger as they keep pace with emerging technologies and trends in food production and processing, and will give inspectors stronger enforcement tools."><a href="/2019/#uid=cfia-sfcr">Safe Food for Canadians Regulations</a></td>
