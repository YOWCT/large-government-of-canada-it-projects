It also includes the fundamental food safety principles of licensing, traceability, and preventative control.

The Spectrum Cloud Platform will allow ISED to assess in more detail where spectrum is not being used and allow for development of new policies that would make opportunities for new users in those areas (e.g., rural and Indigenous communities), as well as bring tools that help the regions do their field work, which is centered around investigating noncompliance (interference, unlicensed use, etc.) . This platform will also set the stage for automating spectrum management so that Canadians are provided access to quality spectrum in an efficient manner, which allows operators to provide quality services."><a href="#uid=ised-sam-cloud">Spectrum Cloud Platform</a></td>

In addition, the modernized business processes and IT solution will enable strong commitments to the research community and other key stakeholders by reducing the administrative burden and supporting increased collaboration. This project is in the planning stage which is expected to be completed by Summer 2017. Costing estimates for the completion of the planning, development, implementation and ongoing maintenance of the grant and scholarship management solution will be finalized in Spring 2017. The two Councils expect the total project cost to exceed $1M.

The plan is to fully implement GCDOCS in the departmentally assigned Azure (MSFT) environment (provided by Shared Services Canada) by July 2022. While implementing GCDOCS, we are also planning a phased-in approach for RDIMS migration to GCDOCS, starting with active documents, then legacy ones. During the implementation of GCDOCS and migration from RDIMS, PS employees will continue to have Read-Only access to RDIMS until all documents have successfully migrated.  The implementation of GCDOCS at PS will be on Premise (not through Public Service and Procurement Canada managed service) and is expected to be on Cloud Azure. GCDOCS, as it is currently with RDIMS, is deemed mission critical for PS and must have failover and disaster recovery (DR) sites to ensure its availability. The GCDOCS project started in October 2020. Information Management, with the help of consultants, have completed consultations with every business unit in the department and have developed a new functional based folder structure. PS has created a GCdocs solution in Smart UI and a direct integration with M365. Employees and consultants have been working on creating an enterprise GCDOCS solution in Azure Kubernetes container. We have also purchased DMZ servers to add functionality to GCDOCS including co-authoring."><a href="#uid=ps-gcdocs">PS adopted RDIMS as the mandatory corporate (up to Protected B) central repository in 2011 and migrated from RDIMS to GCDOCS on the secret network in 2018. The department is now preparing to migrate from RDIMS to GCDOCS on the corporate network. The plan is to fully implement GCDOCS in the departmentally assigned Azure (MSFT) environment (provided by Shared Services Canada) by July 2022.

          <td data-search="psc-gcjobs GC Jobs Transformation Project The Public Service Commission is planning to replace its aging Public Service Resourcing System, also known as GC Jobs, with a new digital recruitment solution. GC Jobs is an aging legacy system that predates the rise of mobile devices and social media. It no longer serves the needs of job seekers, hiring managers and HR professionals. Its outdated architecture and technology make it increasingly complex and cost-prohibitive to maintain or to add new functionality to streamline or simplify recruitment processes. The goal of GC Jobs Transformation is to provide an adaptable, modern, inclusive, user-centric and digital recruiting solution that attracts talent and meets the needs of job seekers, hiring managers and human resources professionals. This work supports key priorities including reducing time to staff; improving data management and data analytics to strengthen recruitment, and increasing the participation of employment equity groups and persons with priority entitlements. The project is still in its planning stage and budget and estimated completion are estimates only."><a href="#uid=psc-gcjobs">GC Jobs Transformation Project The Public Service Commission is planning to replace its aging Public Service Resourcing System, also known as GC Jobs, with a new digital recruitment solution.</a></td>

The Councils have partnered on a project to replace their outdated IT systems and adopt harmonized and simplified grants and scholarship business processes, while leveraging mission critical management solution to achieve greater transparency, effectiveness and efficiency in how the Councils' grants and scholarships are delivered and reported on. In addition, the modernized business processes and IT solution will enable strong commitments to the research community and other key stakeholders by reducing the administrative burden and supporting increased collaboration. This project is in the planning stage which is expected to be completed by Summer 2017. Costing estimates for the completion of the planning, development, implementation and ongoing maintenance of the grant and scholarship management solution will be finalized in Spring 2017. The two Councils expect the total project cost to exceed $1M. Note: The total budget and estimated completion.date of NSERC's IT project will be determined during the planing stage of the project."><a href="#uid=sshrc-rp2">Research Portal 2.0</a></td>

The Transportation Security Clearance Modernization project consists of five inter-related initiatives which help to respond to these challenges by: 1) digitizing the Transport Canada Security Clearance Application and adding the capability to upload documents, reducing the need for manual validation, mail-in and matching application to documents, reducing the environmental impact of printing and storing paper; and creating a common component for any project using DocumentUpload; 2) upgrading aging technology for the Transport Canada Automated Fingerprinting Information System which collects, exchanges and stores biometric data, a key input for security screening; 3) stabilizing the new decision support tool (Vault) which is experiencing Severity 1 issues since its launch to production in August 2021; improving the overall system&rsquo;s performance by automating manual processes and developing detailed reporting capabilities; 4) delivering a service blueprint and an online service portal concept; and 5) conducting an in-depth analysis and recommendations on policy changes and performance measures which provide potential to further improve service levels."><a href="#uid=tc-srccs-mod">Transportation Security Clearance Modernization</a></td>
