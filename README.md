# Large Government of Canada IT projects

This repository powers [a website displaying Government of Canada IT projects over $1 million](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/).

It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and was built with templates adapted from the [OneDly Project Theme](https://github.com/cdeck3r/OneDly-Theme).

## Usage instructions

### Installing

Development of this website requires [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing), [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).

After cloning the repository, run:

```
npm install
```

to install the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) package used for deployments.

### Local development

For local development, use Hugo's built-in server:

```
hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```

To deploy updates to GitHub pages, use:

```
npm run deploy
```

The [generated data table HTML](https://github.com/YOWCT/large-government-of-canada-it-projects/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/tabledata.html) is produced by a [small PHP script](https://github.com/YOWCT/large-government-of-canada-it-projects/blob/master/_handling/update.php). If the CSV file is modified, you can update the data table HTML with:

```
php _handling/update.php
```

After updating the data table HTML (or other content), use the deploy command above to update the live website. You can change the destination GitHub project by editing [`package.json`](https://github.com/YOWCT/large-government-of-canada-it-projects/blob/master/package.json).
